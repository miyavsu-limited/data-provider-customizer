# data-provider-customizer - Merged Data Providers Example

This project is an example of merging two data providers into one with [data-provider-customizer ðŸ’–ðŸš€][dpc]. 

You'll see two resources in the menu: "Users" and "Posts". "Users" sources it's data from [@pankod/refine-simple-rest][simple-rest], "Posts" resource is fetched from [@pankod/refine-supabase][supabase-example]. 

Also, since managing posts requires the application to make requests at a "categories" resource on supabase, `categories` resource is also set to use `supabase`.
